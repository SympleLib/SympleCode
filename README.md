SympleCode is bare-bones programming language with syntax similar to C. As of the moment there isn't much functionality, but I plan to add more functionality.

## How to try it out yourself
Start by cloning the repository using `git clone --recursive https://github.com/TeddyTelanoff/SympleCode/`

Next, run the `GenerateProjects.bat` which will prompt wihch ide you use, Visual Studio 2019 or 2017 is recommended; if you don't know what to type, see [Premake Usages](https://github.com/premake/premake-core/wiki/Using-Premake).

For information on how to use the language, check out the [wiki](../../Wiki)
