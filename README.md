SympleCode is bare-bones programming language with syntax similar to C.

## About SympleCode

SympleCode is a programming language that is meant to be close to the [C Programming Lanaguage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)), but with some of my taste added in.

## How to try it out yourself

```
Disclamer: Symple Code only supports windows at the moment!
```

Start by downloading the SympleCode compiler from [releases](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ). Now make sure you have both clang and the compiler in the same directory. Next open command prompt in your project directory and type `SympleCode.exe <filename>`.

For information on how to use the language, check out the [wiki](../../wiki).
